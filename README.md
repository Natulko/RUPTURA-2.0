# RUPTURA 2.0
## Changes made in comparison to RUPTURA 1.0
The 4 main additions are:
1) implicit solver implementation;
2) isothermal implementation;
3) Ergun equation implementation;
4) Danckwerts boundary condition implementation;

Implementations of (2), (3), and (4) can be found in the corresponding added folders in src. Each folder contains all the files that are different from RUPTURA 1.0.

The current version of the code is implemented with an implicit solver and thus indicates the implementation of (1).

Alternatively, correspondent files/folders can also be identified by the last commit message.

## Usage
Instructions for running RUPTURA are in the README file of RUPTURA 1.0 below. 

To run the implementations of (2), (3) or (4), all the files present in the corresponding folder should be placed instead of the old ones.

The current code is implemented with implicit solvers (1), meaning that (1) does not require any additional action to be run.

# RUPTURA 1.0

## Breakthrough, IAST, and isotherm fitting code
This software is a simulation package to compute breakthrough curves and 
IAST mixture predictions. It has been developed at the Delft University of 
Technology (Delft, The Netherlands), during 2022 in active collaboration
with the University of Amsterdam (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Eindhoven 
University of Technology (Eindhoven, Netherlands), Pablo de Olavide 
University (Seville, Spain), and Shell Global Solutions International B.V.
Amsterdam.

## Features
